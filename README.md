# Fish Eye Freshness Classifier

Overview: 
Freshness of foods is a critical factor in food safety, quality control, and consumer satisfaction. Freshness is typically based on the human senses; the colour, smell, texture and taste of foods. Fish freshness is prescribed the same way. However, the human senses are often subjective and inconsistent. Using a machine learning model, we will mitigate the inconsistencies and subjectivity of the human senses. Our classifier will predict the freshness of fish. 

Significance:
Our classifier will provide a simple and efficient way to quickly and accurately predict the freshness of fish. As a result, we can expect a reduction in food waste by accurately identifying spoilage. This model also promotes food safety for consumers.
